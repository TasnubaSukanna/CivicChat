# CivicChat
Civic Chat is an AI-powered platform that helps people understand local elections, ballot questions, and community services. 
For this MVP, we focus on elections specific to Washington DC.
Users can ask questions in everyday language, and our system searches real government data, summarizes it with Azure OpenAI, and gives clear, neutral explanations. It supports multiple languages, and it’s designed to help communities access civic information quickly, safely, and without misinformation.
